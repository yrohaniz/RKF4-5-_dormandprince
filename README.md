# RKF4-5-_dormandprince
This is an RKF45 solver.
This is the code for an adaptive step size embedded error control integrator. The numerical scheme is known as Dormand-Prince
in the literature and uses order 4 and order 5 integrators for estimating the error and controlling the step size for stability.
